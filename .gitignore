Match_Scorecard/*_Scorecard/

# If the above isn't specific enough, or if files are sometimes outside those folders,
# you can add more specific patterns. But the above *should* work.
# For example, to explicitly ignore all .csv and .log files within any subdirectory of Match_Scorecard:
# Match_Scorecard/**/*.csv
# Match_Scorecard/**/*.log
# However, ignoring the parent output folder (like *_Scorecard/) is usually cleaner.
