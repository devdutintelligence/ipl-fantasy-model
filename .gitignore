  **Important:** The line `Match_Scorecard/*_Scorecard/` is designed to ignore folders like `Match_Scorecard/2016_Scorecard/`, `Match_Scorecard/2017_Scorecard/`, etc., which seem to contain your *output data* based on your previous `git status` output. The folder `Match_Scorecard/` itself, which contains your `.py` scripts, will *not* be ignored by this rule.
