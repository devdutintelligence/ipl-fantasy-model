# Output directories from your season-specific scorecard scripts
# This pattern will match "2007-08_Scorecard/", "2009_Scorecard/", etc.
# located anywhere in the project (so it covers them inside Match_Scorecard/)
*_Scorecard/

# If your season-specific scripts also generate .csv files directly in their own folder
# and you want to ignore those (but NOT the .py scripts), this is trickier with
# broad patterns. For now, focusing on the output folders is safer.
# If CSVs are *only* inside *_scorecard_data/ then the *_Scorecard/ entry above will cover it.

# To be very specific for the nested structure shown in your git status for CSVs:
# Match_Scorecard/*_Scorecard/*_scorecard_data/*.csv
# However, ignoring the parent *_Scorecard/ directory is usually sufficient and cleaner.
